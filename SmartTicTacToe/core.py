# Implements core functionality for a tic-tac-toe AI game
#
# Imported by: strategy.py
# Imported by: mini-shell.py
#
# Imports: random.py
#
# This implementation has no local or global state
# All functions operate on an immutable board parameter
# And return results to the caller
# (except for the old DFS routine to count boards)
#
# There are some redundancies that crept in as the code evolved
# So it could be cleaned up a bit
#
# This version works on N x N boards
